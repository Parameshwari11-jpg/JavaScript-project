The "Guess the Word Game" is a simple and interactive JavaScript project where players try to uncover a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time. A random word is selected, and its letters are represented as underscores. Players input their guesses, which are validated and checked against the word. Correct guesses reveal the letters, while incorrect ones reduce the remaining attempts. The game ends when the player either guesses the word or runs out of attempts. It includes a replay option and can be enhanced with categories or hints for added variety.
